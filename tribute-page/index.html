                <p>From spear heading the creation of reusable rockets and 
                   fully electric vehicles, 
                   Elon Musk is a testament to what hard work, perseverance, and talent can achieve.
                   Although he can sometimes be highly controversial, I believe that right now, he is the person contributing 
                   the most to propelling humanity towards a better future.</p>
