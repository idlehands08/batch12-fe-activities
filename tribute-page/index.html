            <!-- Biography  -->
            <h2 id="Biography">Biography<hr></h2>
            
            <p>Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman 
                who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), 
                SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. 
                Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when 
                he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.  
               </p>
            
            <h2>Early Life <hr></h2>
            
            <p>Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams 
                about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.

                At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, 
                Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program,
                 and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a 
                 game he created called Blastar.</p>

            <h3><a class="subjectLinks" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zip2">Zip2 Corporation</a></h3>
            <p>Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, 
                Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both 
                The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of 
                Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.</p>
            
            <h3><a class="subjectLinks" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/PayPal">PayPal</a></h3>
            <p>In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. 
                An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.

                In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. 
                Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.</p>
            
            <h3><a class="subjectLinks" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/SpaceX">SpaceX</a></h3>
            <p>Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building spacecraft 
                for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle 
                cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace 
                NASA’s own space shuttle missions.</p>
            
            <h3><a class="subjectLinks" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tesla-Motors">Tesla Motors</a></h3>
            <p>Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a company formed in 2003 that is 
                dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. 
                Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the company's products.</p>
            
            <h3><a class="subjectLinks" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boring_Company">The Boring Company</a></h3>
            <p>In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted to 
                boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. 
                He began with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles.</p>
